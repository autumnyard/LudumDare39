## GDD

### Description ###
- Top down 2D game, free real time movement.
- To finish a level you must take all the VHS and then go to the end.
- You can move normally and dash. 
  - Dash has a delay.
  - Dash can break momentum.
- Health has a maximum, never surpassing it.
- Six levels, of increasing complexity.
- Each movement you make, you lose health.
  - Dash doesn't consume health.
- The icecream recovers your health.
- There's a timer, which acts as a score.
- There are X levels.
  - If you die you continue in the one you died, with the timer still counting.
  - If you finish the game, the level counter resets.
- Vaporwave aesthetics.
  - Will sample some neat tunes for the music, and apply heavy reverbs, delays and cutoffs.
  - Will use heavily delayed cuts from those songs as sfx.
  - Heavy usage of tweens. Tweens abound!
  - Saturated colors, mostly pink and blue.


### Input
- ** Move **: Arrow keys or WASD.
- ** Dash **: CTRL, SHIFT, Number 0 or SPACE.
