### Description ###
- Top down 2D game, free real time movement.
- To finish a level you must take all the VHS and then go to the end.
- You can move normally, or dash. 
  - Dash has a delay
  - Dash can break momentum.
- Health has a maximum, never surpassing it.

- There are X levels.
  - If you die you continue in the one you died, with the timer still counting.
