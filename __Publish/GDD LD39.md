## Ludum Dare 39 ~ Running out of power ##

### Description ###
- Top down, free real time movement.
- To finish a level you must take all the stars and then go to the end.

** Health **
- Health can be up to a maximum, never surpassing it.
  - Currently 20, but may change on a level basis.
  
- Each movement you make, you lose health.
  - At first I made that you lose health with time.
  - Only when you move, you lose health.
  - Option A: Only when an input is pressed.
  - Option B: When you're moving for any reason: passive force or momentum.
  - I guess I'll be going for A.

** Capsules **
- There are capsules all over the map to recover health.


### Input ###
- Arrow keys or WASD.
